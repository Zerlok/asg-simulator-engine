# ASG Engine repo #

This is the core of the ASG game. We have to write our own engine, because we want to do that! Of course a lot of bad code will be written... Sorry.

If you have any ideas or have an advice for us, please, write to denergytro@gmail.com with subject "ASG".

## How to run that? ##

Just install QtCreator and pull that repo. If you want to run gtest app, you have to install Google Unit Tests on your machine.
